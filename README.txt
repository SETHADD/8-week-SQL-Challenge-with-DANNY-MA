This has codes from the first case study of the 8-week-challenge created by Danny Ma.
I copied his code into MSSM (SQL Server) where I created 3 tables
which holds the data on;
Sales
Menu
Members
The sales and the Members tables were joined by the Customer_id.
The Sales and the Menu tables were connected by the product_id.

I explored different functions to answer the questions
Here, the power of SQL especially the window functions was brought to 
bear here.

For the window functions, I find this resource particularly helpful.
